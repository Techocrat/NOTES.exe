## Project Overview
The User and Notes Management System is a comprehensive web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It empowers administrators to efficiently manage users and their notes while providing a secure and user-friendly experience. Key features include user authentication, admin privileges, notes management, invitation links for user registration, and responsive design. 

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication**: Users can easily register, log in, and log out. Authentication is securely handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

2. **Admin Privileges**: Administrators enjoy advanced functionalities, including viewing all users, promoting users to admins, and viewing specific user notes.

3. **Notes Management**: Users can effortlessly create, read, update, and delete their notes. Administrators can view and manage notes across all users.

4. **Invitation Link**: User registration is restricted to those with valid invitation links generated by administrators.

5. **Toast Notifications**: User-friendly toast notifications are employed throughout the application to provide feedback on success and error messages.

6. **Database**: MongoDB serves as the database, effectively storing user information and notes.

7. **Frontend**: The project's frontend is constructed using React, and it boasts a polished and responsive interface enhanced by Tailwind CSS.

8. **Responsive Design**: The user interface is thoughtfully designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Getting Started
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and navigate to both the client and server directories. Run `npm install` to install dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

2. **Environment Variables**: Set up your environment variables for the backend, including the MongoDB connection string and JWT secret.

3. **Database**: Ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running. You can set up a MongoDB database and specify the connection string in your environment variables.

4. **Start the Application**: Run `npm start` in the server directory to start the server. Then, navigate to the client directory and run `npm start` to start the React app. The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
